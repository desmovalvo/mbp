------------------------------------

Requirements:

* python
* python's termcolor module



Usage:

$ python publisher.py --owner NAME --manager=MANAGER_IP:PORT --sib=REALSIB_IP:PORT --action=ACTION

Here's a list of the mandatory parameters: 

* owner: this is the owner of the real SIB. This is needed for the
registration process that allows a SIB to become discoverable

* manager: this field requires the manager's IP address and the port

* sib: ip address and port of the SIB to publish/register

* action: can be "publish" (to make a SIB reachable and discoverable)
  or "register" in order to make a pure registration (useful for hosts
  that already have a public IP address)

Once the software is started, it can be stopped with CTRL-C
